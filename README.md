Subject "Edge Control"

This repository contains a software project involving the collection and processing of machine data from a robot arm.

Data is provided by an MQTT broker and then forwarded to an balenaFin board. This board is administrated through the balenaCloud and forwards data to a ThingsBoard dashboard to provide a quick overview of the machine data.

The goal of this project was to create a system that makes it easy to collect data, add new machines and update existing ones with as little downtime as possible.
